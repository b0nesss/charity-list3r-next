# Charity List3r

This project was made during internal hackathon of BlocSoc IITR and it is the frontend of <a href="https://github.com/b0nesss/charity-web3">Charity List3r </a>.
## Tools Used

- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project. 
- Tailwind CSS was used for styling of different pages.
- Web3UIKit was used for the connect wallet component .
- Metamask
## Challenges faced
- Integration of the backend and frontend in this project proved to be a significant challenge for us, given our limited experience with Next.js. However, we successfully overcame this obstacle within the given time constraints.
- One of the major challenges we faced was parsing various data types or objects received from the backend. For example, we had to handle parsing of "bigNumber" data type when rendering ether amount. This proved to be a complex task that required careful handling and conversion.
